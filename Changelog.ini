Comments= <<EOT
- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Spec::Changes.
- Move t/pod.t to xt/author/.
- Add t/version.t.
- Switch from Hash::FieldHash to Moo. But not Moops - I don't need that level of complexity.
- If file_name is provided to new(), it is not checked for absolute/relative (it never was), but rather
it is just used as provided. This means stop using File::HomeDir.
If file_name is not provided to new(), default to 'dsn.ini'.
This also means stop using Try::Tiny. That is now up to the user of this module.
- The our variable $errstr has been removed. All errors die with a message.
- Clean up handling of situations when the user does not specify any value for various attributes.
Previously, these were assumed to exist and/or not set properly when a file was written.
- Add use strict and use warnings to Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
- Newsflash: DBIx::Admin::CreateTable and DBIx::Admin::DSNManager are now used for the author's testing of
DBIx::Admin::TableInfo.
